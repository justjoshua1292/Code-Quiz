# Code-Quiz
Assignment 4 (Code Quiz)


Not only is this task an homework assignment, it is also prep for future coding assessment testing that ties into some interview processes for various coding jobs across the world. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
This weekâ€™s homework tells us to build a coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that is written by us. By the time the site is complete, it will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
